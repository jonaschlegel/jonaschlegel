# Jona Schlegel – Founder • Archaeology Science Communication • (Conceptual) Illustration x Programming

Hi, I’m Jona, an archaeologist, illustrator, and science communicator originally from Berlin, currently based in Vienna, and soon moving to Amsterdam. My work focuses on integrating archaeology with digital communication, creating accessible and visually engaging resources that bring archaeological insights to both professional and public audiences. Through **archaeoINK**, I combine research, illustration, and digital tools to support the archaeological community and enhance public engagement with heritage.

## Areas of Expertise

### Scientific Communication
Creating visually compelling resources, such as zines, infographics, and web content, to make complex archaeological information clear and accessible for diverse audiences.

### Knowledge Management
Designing and structuring CIDOC CRM-compliant databases and controlled vocabularies, supporting robust data sharing and reporting that keeps archaeological data organised, searchable, and transferable.

## Featured Projects

- **[Roman Burial](https://jonaschlegel.com/projects/roman-burial)** – A detailed exploration and visualisation of Roman burial practices, combining illustration with digital mapping to uncover burial customs and their cultural significance.
  
- **[Urban Chameleon](https://jonaschlegel.com/projects/urban-chameleon)** – Developed as part of [Project INDIGO](https://projectindigo.eu/), this project investigates the intersection of urban space and heritage, capturing how urban graffiti reflects shifting cultural landscapes and collective memory.

## Tools and Skills

- **Programming**: TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, SCSS
- **Mapping**: QGIS, ArcGIS
- **Illustration**: Procreate, Blender, Nomad Sculpt

## Current Work

Currently engaged in #Inktober2024, exploring archaeology’s broader questions through conceptual illustration. Each drawing is designed to inspire reflection and dialogue, blending traditional ink styles with digital techniques.
